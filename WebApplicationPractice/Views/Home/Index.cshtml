    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>
        I have been performing in musicals and plays for over 10 years, participating in more than 25 productions. 
        Throughout my journey, I have had the privilege of bringing various characters to life, each with its own 
        unique challenges and rewards. Some of my favorite roles include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Jack Kelly</strong> in <em>Newsies</em> – A dream role where I learned leadership, resilience, and the power of fighting for what’s right.</li>
        <li><strong>Rolf</strong> in <em>The Sound of Music</em> – A deeply layered character whose transformation was exciting to portray.</li>
        <li><strong>The Baker</strong> in <em>Into the Woods</em> – A role that taught me about storytelling and character development.</li>
        <li><strong>Wilford Woodruff & King Follett</strong> in <em>The Nauvoo and British Pageants</em> – An experience that strengthened my faith and love for history.</li>
        <li><strong>Dr. Bradman</strong> in <em>Blithe Spirit</em> – A comedic role that challenged my timing and delivery.</li>
    </ul>

        During the summer of 2024, I had the incredible opportunity to perform in the <em>Nauvoo and British Pageants</em> 
        as Wilford Woodruff and King Follett. This experience was more than just a performance; it was a chance to connect with people, 
        share stories of faith, and witness the impact that theater can have in strengthening testimonies. Performing in such a historic setting, 
        surrounded by dedicated individuals, reminded me of the power of storytelling to inspire and uplift others. 
        Each night, we saw families draw closer to Christ and gain a deeper appreciation for the sacrifices made by early pioneers.

        In 2021, I had the privilege of playing Rolf in <em>The Sound of Music</em> at Hale Center Theater Orem. 
        This show was one of the most rewarding experiences of my career. The story of Maria and the von Trapp family is timeless, and 
        being part of a production that touched so many hearts was truly special. Beyond the performances, our cast became like a family, 
        supporting and encouraging each other throughout the entire run. The show itself carried a powerful message about love, courage, and 
        the transformative power of music, and I will always cherish the memories made on that stage.
